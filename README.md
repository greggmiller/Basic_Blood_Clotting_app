ROTEM

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This is a relatively simple app that involves medical staff entering the results of a blood test from a specialist machine (ROTEM thromboelastography) that we have at Western Health. The app interprets these results using the algorithm coded within its programming to help guide blood product choice and administration. 

The ROTEM is a relatively new technology which is used to analyse the blood clotting of patients with major haemorrhage. At Western Health we predominantly use the ROTEM for obstetric patients having a significant postpartum haemorrhage. Itâ€™s advantages over traditional lab-based tests are that it is a point-of-care test which gives quicker results. It also gives a more complete picture of the coagulation process than traditional lab tests so can more precisely guide the type of blood product required in bleeding patients.
It may hvae some use in COVID19 patients as they are prone to blood clotting abnormalities, including microthrombi.
It would be useful to have this in the cross-skilling section of the app.

The main objectives of the app are to simplify the interpretation of the ROTEM results for patients and ease the cognitive load of anaesthetists and theatre staff during  a major haemorrhage which can be a resource-intensive crisis. The interpretation of results are currently based on a graphical algorithm which can be challenging to interpret in such circumstances or to those who are not familiar with it, such as rotating anaesthetic registrars.
